# Programming Paradigms

Course work in DD1361 - Programming Paradigms. Description of course is as follows.

## Intended learning outcomes
After the course the student should be able to

+ apply and explain common concepts in programming: recursion, control flow, interpreting, paradigms
+ apply and explain basic concepts of functional programming: higher-order functions, currying, lazy evaluation, pattern matching, types and classes
+ apply and explain basic concepts of logic programming: unification, backtracking, cuts, negation and different programming techniques such as generate-test
+ apply and explain basic concepts in formal languages and syntax analysis: automata, regular expressions, grammars, lexical analysis, and recursive descent
+ write their own client-server and use protocols and explain how they are interpreted and written

in order to

+ get a broader perspective on programming,
+ judge which paradigm and which programming language that is appropriate for solving a specific task,
+ use the appropriate style of programming in the selected programming paradigm,
+ actively participate in discussions about programming paradigms, programming language history, language definition, properties of type systems, principles of language design, language translation, programming principles and programming concepts.
